# notes-mode-pharo-smalltalk: An elegant note taking environment

I have been keeping notes, by way of markdown-files-in-a-folder, for a long time. I even developed a structure around these notes. Think [OrgMode](https://orgmode.org/) just not as good. 

I originally developed a set of helper scripts as a BBEdit package (still unpublished). Then, as my life became more based around iOS, ported some of those scripts to Editorial (unpublished).

Then my life became very cross-platform, with the addition of a Linux laptop and (a year later) a day job on Windows. I had been using Pharo Smalltalk as a personal developer workspace for a while, so started to port by scripts to Smalltalk.

This repo is the result. Likely only useful to me, but whatever.
